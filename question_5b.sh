# QUESTION_5B
# Description: Bash script that accepts a file or directory name as an argument.

# This will ensure a user enters an argument, which is the file or directory to be checked
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    sleep 2s
    echo "Usage: $0 <file_or_directory>"
    sleep 1s
    exit 2

# This is to alert the user if the file or directory entered as argument does not exist
if [ ! -e "$1" ]; then
    sleep 2s
    echo "Error: $1 does not exist."
    sleep 1s
    exit 2

# If the file or directory entered exists, this checks whether the file or directory is a file or directory or some other type of file
